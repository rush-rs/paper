\subsection{RISC vs CISC Architectures}

\TODO{RISC vs. CISC~\cite[p.~5-6]{Dandamudi2005}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item RISC-V was less demanding and better
\end{itemize}

% TODO: the below goes under conclusions
% \section{CISC and RISC Architectures}
%
% \subsubsection{CISC}
% % CISC was chosen to be the first one on purpose
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item X86 (64) as an example (briefly)
% 	\item CISC architectures date back to the time in which Assembly was written by hand.
% 	      Programs were easier to write and often performed better due to these complex instructions.
% 	      Larger quantity of instructions in CISC architectures.
% 	\item Complex \& many instructions cause the architecture to be a bit slower for compiled programs
% \end{itemize}
%
% \subsubsection{RISC}
%
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item RISC-V as an example (briefly)
% 	\item Rather modern
% 	\item Better for modern CPUs which mostly execute machine-written code
% 	\item Harder to write manually
% 	\item Easier to implement a compiler for
% 	\item Usually small and very simple instruction set
% 	\item Gain in popularity (ARM / RISC-V)
% \end{itemize}
