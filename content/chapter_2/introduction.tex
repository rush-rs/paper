After the syntactical and semantic analysis, there are now multiple different ways to continue.
The first one shown here is an \emph{interpreter}, which, contrary to a compiler, executes the analyzed program directly.
That means, no output to be run by another process is produced and written to disk.
Instead, everything is kept in memory and immediately evaluated by the interpreter.

Therefore, compared to a compiler, the \emph{interpreter} not only has to be installed on the developer's machine, but also on the target machine.
This chapter presents two fundamentally different ways of implementing an interpreted programming language.
