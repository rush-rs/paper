\section{Using LLVM for Code Generation}

LLVM is a software project intended to simplify the construction of a compiler generating highly-performant output programs.
It originally started as a project by \emph{Chris Lattner} at the University of Illinois.
Since then, the project has been widely adopted by the open source community.
Today, it can be recognized as one of the largest open source projects.
