\section{The rush Programming Language}

For this paper, we have developed and implemented a simple programming language called \emph{rush}\footnote{Capitalization of the name is omitted intentionally.}.
The language features a \emph{static type system}, six different data types\footnote{Including the \qVerb{int}, \qVerb{float}, \qVerb{bool}, \qVerb{char}, \emph{unit}, and \emph{never} type.}, \emph{arithmetic operators}, \emph{logical operators}, \emph{local and global variables}, \emph{pointers}, \emph{if-else expressions}, \emph{loops}, and \emph{functions}.
In order to introduce the language, we will now consider the code in Listing~\ref{lst:rush_fib}.

\Lirsting[caption={Generating Fibonacci numbers using rush.}, label={lst:rush_fib}, float=H]{listings/fib.rush}

This rush program can be used to generate numbers included in the Fibonacci sequence.
In the code, a function named \qVerb{fib} is defined using the \qVerb{fn} keyword.
This function accepts the parameter \qVerb{n} which denotes the position in the Fibonacci sequence of the number to be calculated.
Since \qVerb{int} is specified as the type of the parameter, the function may be called using any integer value as its argument.
However, the constraint $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$ must be valid in order for this function to return the correct result\footnote{Assuming the function should comply with the original Fibonacci definition.}.
In this example, the \qVerb{main} function calls the \qVerb{fib} function using the natural number `10'.
In rush, every valid program must contain exactly one \qVerb{main} function since that is where program execution will start.
Even though rush has a \qVerb{return} statement, the body of the \qVerb{fib} function contains no such statement.
This is because blocks like the one of the function \qVerb{fib} return the result of their last expression.
The if-else construct is also an expression since it represents the last entity in the block, and it is not followed by a semicolon.
If the input parameter \qVerb{n} is less than `2', it is returned without modification.
Otherwise, the function calls itself recursively in order to calculate the sum of the preceding Fibonacci numbers `$n - 2$' and `$n - 1$'.
The result value of the entire if-expression is calculated by using one of the two branches.
Since the if-else construct is also an expression, there is no need for a redundant \qVerb{return} statement.
In line 2, the \qVerb{exit} function is called.
Even though this function is not defined anywhere, the code still executes without any errors.
This is due to the fact that the \qVerb{exit} function is a \emph{built-in} function that is used to exit a program using the specified exit code.

\subsection{Features}

As hinted previously, rush implements various features which are also found in most other relevant programming languages today.
Generally, rush is a \emph{procedural} programming language, meaning that code is partitioned into \emph{procedures}, which are commonly referred to as `functions'.
This paradigm has been selected as it is also common across most of today's popular programming languages~\cite[p.~278]{Tucker2007-qr}.
In order to provide abstractions, rush provides many features which are meant to increase developer productivity.
For instance, a program might use a \qVerb{loop} to implement code repetition easily.
For reference, Table~\ref{tbl:rush_features} shows some features of the rush programming language.

		infix-expression        & Performs mathematical and logical operations.                           & \LirstInline{rush}{1 + n; 5 ** 2}                \\

		let-statement           & Defines a variable with an initial value.                               & \LirstInline{rush}{let mut answer = 42}          \\
		cast-expression         & Converts a value into a different type.                                 & \LirstInline{rush}{42 as float}                  \\
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Just like most other compiled languages, rush also includes a \emph{static type system},
meaning that every variable has a type which cannot change during runtime.
For instance, after a new variable which can hold integers was defined,
only integer values may be assigned to it. This way, the compiler can validate the semantic
correctness of the program, showing error messages if an erroneous program is provided.
Apart from mandating a program's correctness, a static type system also makes the program easier to read later.
Therefore, the rush programming language is designed in a way that promotes correctness and programmer efficiency.
Table~\ref{tbl:rush_types} provides an overview about all the types which are present in rush.

While the first four types are self-explanatory, the last two types demand special explanation.
The \emph{unit} type is used in order to denote that a function returns no value.
This concept is comparable to \emph{void} in other languages, like C or Java.
In rush however, the unit type is treated like a value at runtime.
Even though the unit type can be saved inside a variable or used as a function parameter, all rush compilers simply ignore it since it holds no value.
In the rush code in Listing~\ref{lst:rush_fib}, the \qVerb{main} function also returns the unit type.
For instance, a function \qVerb{foo} can be defined like `\LirstInline{rush}{fn foo() -> () {}}', as well as `\LirstInline{rush}{fn foo() {}}'.
Therefore, manually specifying that a function returns the unit type is redundant.
The \emph{never} type is used in order to denote that an expression or statement interrupts the normal control flow, so that the construct never yields a value.
Because the built-in \qVerb{exit} function terminates a program, its result will never be of relevance.
However, the fact that the never type is returned is relevant as this information is valuable for the semantic analysis and the compilers.
Furthermore, \qVerb{break}, \qVerb{continue}, and \qVerb{return} also result in the never type.
It is to be noted that the type cannot be used explicitly, meaning syntax like `\LirstInline{rush}{let a: ! = exit(0)}' is illegal as it would not create any practical benefits.

In the rush project, most of the previously presented stages of compilation are implemented as their own individual code modules.
This way, each component of the programming language can be developed, tested, and maintained separately.
In the git commit \rushCommit{}, the entire rush project consisted of
\tokei{./deps/rush}lines of source code\footnote{Every specification of line count does not count blank lines and comments.}.
On the first sight, this might seem like a large number for a simple programming language.
However, the rush project includes a lexer, a parser, a semantic analyzer, five compilers, one interpreter, and several other tools like a language server for editor support.
Table~\ref{tbl:rush_loc_components} shows the lines of code of the project's individual components.
Here, it becomes apparent that the tree-walking interpreter contains the least amount of code, as it is the simplest.
The compilers targeting high level targets both require around 1,500 lines.
As for the low-level compilers, they both require over 2000 lines of code, with x64 requiring around 500 lines more than \riscv{}.
By considering this table, the complexity of the individual components become apparent.
