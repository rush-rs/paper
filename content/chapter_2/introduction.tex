Unlike a compiler, an \emph{interpreter} presents a way of executing the source program directly.
Therefore, the interpreter often omits translation of the source program into target instructions.

Furthermore, the interpreter for an interpreted source language is always required in order to run a source program.
However, a compiler is only used for the initial step of translation.
After this, the generated instructions can usually be interpreted directly, without the need for an executing program.
In this chapter, we will present two fundamentally different ways of implementing an interpreted programming language.
