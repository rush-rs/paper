	\section*{Acknowledgements}
	We would like to express our sincere gratitude towards our supervisor -- \emph{Sonja Sokolovi\'c} for her invaluable supervision and support during the creation of this paper.
	Our gratitude extends to our school, the CFG Wuppertal which allowed us to pursue this research project as part of our finals.
	Due to this paper, both of us gained lots of invaluable knowledge about compilers, interpreters, and low-level programming.
	Even though the past months were very stressful, this project was very enjoyable, even though bugs kept us awake more times than we would like to admit.
	Without the opportunity presented by our school, this project, and everything that comes with it would have not been part of our education.
	Additionally, we would like to thank our classmate -- \emph{Fatima} for designing the initial version of the rush logo.
